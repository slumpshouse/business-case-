## 🧩 **Component Architecture**

### **Page Components (7)**
```jsx
Home.jsx         - Landing page with career field selection
Login.jsx        - Authentication interface
Resume.jsx       - AI-powered resume builder with chat
Analysis.jsx     - Comprehensive analysis dashboard
Job.jsx          - Job search and browsing interface
Apply.jsx        - Application submission system
JobsLanding.jsx  - Job overview and navigation page
```

### **Reusable Components (4)**
```jsx
Header.jsx       - Fixed navigation with auth integration
Buttons.jsx      - Standardized button components
JobCard.jsx      - Individual job listing display
Logo.jsx         - Brand identity component

## 🔄 **Data Flow Architecture**

### **State Management Layers**
1. **Local State** (useState) - Component-specific data and UI state
2. **Context State** (useContext) - Global authentication and user data  
3. **Route State** (useLocation) - Page-to-page data transfer

### **API Integration Pattern**
```jsx
// OpenAI API Integration
fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [...conversationHistory],
    temperature: 0.3,
    max_tokens: 2000
  })
});
```
